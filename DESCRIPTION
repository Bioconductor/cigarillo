Package: cigarillo
Title: Efficient manipulation of CIGAR strings
Description: CIGAR stands for Concise Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report.
	The cigarillo package provides utility functions to parse CIGAR
	strings, convert them into ranges of positions, and transform
	aligned query or reference sequences based on the CIGAR strings that
	describe how they align. These utility functions are rarely used
	directly by the user but are typically used by higher-level packages
	like Bioconductor packages GenomicAlignments and igblastr.
